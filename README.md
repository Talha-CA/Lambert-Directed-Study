Navigate to the Code branch, where you will find LambertBatch, downloading this code, as well as the subfunctions: planet_elements_and_sv.m, J0.m, kepler_E.m, sv_from_coe.m, and Func_Lambert_Mars.m

Credit for the subfunctions: planet_elements_and_sv.m, J0.m, kepler_E.m, and sv_from_coe.m go to Howard Curtis, where these subfunctions were included in his textbook - Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students.
